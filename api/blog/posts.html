{"posts":[{"content":"As many of you may know, I have been involved in Competitive Programming for a very long time, and while preparing for those contests, I didn't spend any of my time on actual projects. Lately, I thought that it would be a good time
to branch out and try out stuff that I haven't done before.\n\nNow I have to admit, I have done a bit of web development before I went into CP, but it was barely anything. I had some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript (and JQuery, remember
when that was still a thing?). However, I didn't really spend much time and the stuff I made looked like they were from a time before I was even born.\n\nSo I basically time-traveled 6 years into the future. I look around the web development ecosystem,
and there are all these new frameworks which I have never heard of before. And it seems like a lot of technologies like PHP have disappeared! There's also all this hype around NoSQL and Serverless Functions.\n\nThere is way too much to learn, so I decided
to just stick with frontend stuff at first. I was recommended [React](https://reactjs.org) and I thought it was a pretty good idea because knowledge in React directly transferred over to [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), so I could tackle web,
Android, and iOS all at once.\n\nAfter going through [the tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), I realized that the way that React forms Apps out of these Components is pretty cool, and it felt like the object-oriented nature of Java
applied to the JavaScript I was using before on my webpages.\n\nI made a personal page (which I didn't end up uploading because I didn't like it that much) and that was about it. I didn't do much since I was struggling for hours on CSS formatting and
I had schoolwork to take care of.\n\nAfter that, I played around with React Native and didn't make much either.\n\nOn 12/17/20, I was searching up random frameworks (trying to get an idea of what they do) and I stumbled across [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
The stuff it was able to do seemed pretty cool. Vercel (the creator of Next.js) gave SSL for free and it seemed really simple to make some simple backend stuff happen so I decided to make this website with Next.js.\n\nI decided that [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
would take care of some of my CSS to make my site look better, so I installed it. Shortly after, I was threatened by my friend to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead so I switched. I still continue to use the icons that Bootstrap provide.\n\nAs
a fun exercise, I decided to make a [voting page](/200kvote) for my YouTube channel (I did too much work for this but I did learn a lot). There was more complexity in the React components, and I also had to learn a bit of Firebase for my database.\n\nI
spent some time after that working on my Discord bot, then I came back and decided that I should create a blog, so here we are now.\n","slug":"3-months-of-web-dev","title":"3 Months of Web Development","timestamp":1612254060000,"desc":"What I've learned
